# Breast Cancer
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting medical costs based on given patient data.

**Dataset Despcription**

The features in the dataset are named as 1,2,3,5 ... so we will have to rename them in the preprocessing.

ID: A unique identifier for each patient (this feature is not used in analysis).
Clump Thickness: Measures the thickness of the clumps of cells. A higher value indicates a more substantial clump.

Uniformity of Cell Size: Reflects how consistent the size of the cells is. Higher values indicate a greater variation in cell sizes.

Uniformity of Cell Shape: Reflects how consistent the shape of the cells is. Higher values indicate more variation in cell shapes.

Marginal Adhesion: Describes how closely the cells stick to each other. A higher value suggests poor adhesion, which is often associated with malignancy.

Single Epithelial Cell Size: Measures the size of individual epithelial cells. Larger sizes can indicate malignancy.

Bare Nuclei: Counts the number of nuclei that are not surrounded by cytoplasm. More bare nuclei are typically associated with cancerous cells.

Bland Chromatin: Assesses the texture of the chromatin in the cell nuclei. Coarser textures are often linked to malignancy.

Normal Nucleoli: Reflects the presence of nucleoli in the cell. A higher count suggests abnormal nucleoli, which is a common characteristic of cancerous cells.
Mitoses: Counts the number of cells undergoing mitosis. A higher mitotic rate is an indicator of malignancy.

Class: The target variable, where 2 indicates benign and 4 indicates malignant.
